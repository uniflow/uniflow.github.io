      <p>Uniflow is a flux-inspired unidirectional data flow library. It works
      great with React.js, but it could be used just as easily with any other
      view library. The primary goal of Uniflow is simplicity. The entire 
      <code>lib</code> directory can be read and understood in minutes. Uniflow
      offers just enough to give your application the structure it needs. 
      Give it a try!</p>
